{"name":"page-changer","body":"# page-changer\r\n\r\n### File alteration bot for programmatically altering large amount of files with Regular Expressions\r\n\r\npage-changer can be used to search through text based files and make change to the text by adding, deleting, changing or a combination of all three.\r\n\r\nThis is done using a config file to tell page-changer what to alter in what file type.\r\n\r\n#### Installation\r\n\r\npage-changer is a single file script so it can just be downloaded on its own. \r\n\r\nIt does have a dependancy on [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML), so this needs to be installed on the system along with Python.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\npage-changer uses a YAML config file that you specify as a command line argument to know what files to change.\r\n\r\nThe format of the config file is:\r\n\r\n      - name: <name of the set>\r\n        criteria: <string or reg ex that must be present in the file for it to be processed>\r\n        remove:\r\n            - <reg ex to remove from line>\r\n              \r\n        replace: \r\n            - find: <text to that will be replaced use %rep%>\r\n              replace: <text to replace>\r\n                \r\n      - name: ... <put n or more parser sets, to parse different file types, or alterations required>\r\n\r\nAn example file would be:\r\n\r\n    - name: html\r\n      criteria: findme\r\n      mask: 'Search.html'\r\n      remove:\r\n      - <head>\r\n      - <html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n      - </head>\r\n      - <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\r\n      - </html>\r\n      - </body>\r\n      - <body>\r\n      replace:\r\n      - find: colou*r\r\n        replace: something else\r\n\r\nTo run the config over a set of files use the command line tool:\r\n\r\n    python page-changer.py config.yaml /path/to/files/to/search\r\n    \r\nHere are the command line options and arguments:\r\n\r\n    usage: page-changer.py [-h] [--recursive] C D\r\n\r\n    Mass edit text files.\r\n\r\n    positional arguments:\r\n      C                Config file to use.\r\n      D                Directory to search for files to change.\r\n\r\n    optional arguments:\r\n      -h, --help       show this help message and exit\r\n      --recursive, -r  Recursivly search for files inside dir.","tagline":"File alteration bot for programmatically altering large amount of files with Regular Expressions.","google":"UA-31949029-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
